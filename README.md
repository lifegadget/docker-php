## Warning ##

This documentation is a well ahead of the implementation. This is an active work-in-progress and this warning will be removed once things have stablized (or at least the implementation has caught up to the documentation). 

## Overview ##

This automated-builder produces a docker image that runs:

- PHP
- FPM (socket and TCP connections)

It is meant to work together seemlessly with the NGINX reverse proxy services and should work equally as well with Apache 2.4+ reverse proxies (although this the latter is not tested).


## Usage ##

### Run / Start

For those on *\*nix* systems it usually makes sense to connect your NGINX or Apache webserver to a Unix socket rather than a TCP port. In either case you should make a conscious choice and then configure accordingly. Configuration is done in two places:

- FPM Pool Configuration Files

	Typically you would create a configuration file per FPM pool and put it into the "pool.d" directory so that FPM would pick it up. With this container you have two choices:

	1. Container managed

		If you're running a single pool -- which is often the case -- then you can simply set either the `FPM_SOCKET_DIRECTORY` environment or the `FPM_PORT_variable and a reasonable default pool configuration will be built for you using Unix sockets. variable to either `port` or `socket` in the Docker *run* command and the configuration file will be automagically created for you by the container. Blamo. 

		Here's an example of setting it to run a single socket-connected application:

		````bash
		# Specify where on host system to put Unix sockets
		FPM_SOCKET_DIRECTORY=/host/path/to/sockets
		# Just do it
		sudo docker run -d \
			-v $FPM_SOCKET_DIRECTORY=/etc/php5/fpm/sockets \
			--name=MY_APP -t lifegadget/docker-php 
		````

		

	1. Host configured

		If you're running multiple pools, want to have detailed control over pool parameters, or just suffer from control issues then you'll want to set a volume share with something like the following added to the Docker *run* command:

			# Specify a host directory for your pool configuration files
			FPM_POOL_DIRECTORY=/path/to/pools
			# Docker run
			
		> In order to run in "host configured" mode you'll need to ensure that neither `FPM_SOCKET` or `FPM_PORT` are set.


- Docker Run Configuration

The variation will take place primarily with configuring your FPM-pool configuration files. On your host you'll choose a directory -- let's assume `/path/to/pools` for demonstration purposes -- and then put one or more configuration files (typically one per service) in there that will look something like:
 
- `/path/to/pools/socket-service.ini`

	````bash
	[socketservice]
	; keep in mind file structure should be 
	; from the perspective of the container not host filesystem
	; this is not ideal as it forces implementation details of container to host
	; but for now that is the way it is ... live with it
	listen = /etc/php5/fpm/sockets/socket-service.socket
	listen.mode = 0666
	pm = dynamic
	pm.max_children = 10
	pm.start_servers = 3
	pm.min_spare_servers = 2
	pm.max_spare_servers = 5
	````

- `/path/to/pools/tcp-service.ini`

	````bash
	[tcpservice]
	listen = 127.0.0.1:5000
	pm = dynamic
	pm.max_children = 10
	pm.start_servers = 3
	pm.min_spare_servers = 2
	pm.max_spare_servers = 5
	````

Once configured you'll want to run the following:

````bash
# Give your container a meaningful name
FPM_CONTAINER=PHP_FPM
# The host's root directory for serving content
FPM_WEBSITE_ROOT=/path/to/website
# Specify a host directory for your pool configuration files
FPM_POOL_DIRECTORY=/path/to/pools
# Specify a host directory for socket files
FPM_SOCKET_DIRECTORY=/path/to/sockets

# Unix Sockets
sudo docker run -d \
	--name=$FPM_CONTAINER -t lifegadget/docker-php \
	-v $FPM_WEBSITE_ROOT:/website \
	-v $FPM_POOL_DIRECTORY=/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d 
	-v $FPM_SOCKET_DIRECTORY=/etc/php5/fpm/sockets 
	
# TCP Sockets
sudo docker run -d \
	--name=$FPM_CONTAINER -t lifegadget/docker-php \
	-v $FPM_WEBSITE_ROOT:/website \
	-v $FPM_POOL_DIRECTORY=/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d 
	-p 1080:5000 -p 1081:6000 -p 1082:7000 
````

> **Note:** the TCP Sockets example assumes three pools are configured and that they are internal to the container configured on ports 5000, 6000, and 7000 respectively. In the case of the Unix Sockets, where having more than one pool configured would result in multiple socket files, there is no need to state anything in the docker *run* command because we're simply pointing to the directory in which the socket files will reside. The names of of these sockets will be  

At this point your container should be running (check using `sudo docker ps`) and the FPM services -- whether through TCP or Unix sockets -- should be available to the host to be consumed by NGINX, Apache, or some other service.


###Management

- Generic Container Management	

	````bash
	# Start
	sudo docker start $FPM_CONTAINER
	# Stop
	sudo docker stop $FPM_CONTAINER
	# Restart
	sudo docker restart $FPM_CONTAINER
	# Container details
	sudo docker inspect $FPM_CONTAINER
	# Logging/STDOUT of container
	sudo docker logs $FPM_CONTAINER
	````

- Exposed Command Interface

## Versions / Tags ##

Various versions will be made available. Docker tags include:

- `latest`: the latest version checked into the '5.6' features branch
- `stable`: the latest version checked into the '5.5' features branch
- `5.6`: same as 'latest'
- `5.5`: same as 'stable'
- `5.4`: the latest release in the 5.4 features branch
- `5.3`: the latest release in the 5.3 features branch 

> **Note:** the 5.3 and 5.4 feature branches don't have much of a functional goal for us right now so these are effectively untested
